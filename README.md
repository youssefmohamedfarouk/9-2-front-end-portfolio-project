# 9-2-front-end-portfolio-project

For my front-end portfolio project, I've created a movie search website that utilizes The Movie Database's public API.

Website Link: https://youssefmohamedfarouk.github.io/9-2-front-end-portfolio-project/

The home page shows a list of the top 20 most popular movies right now - the page displays backdrop tiles by default, and the names when you hover your mouse over each.

Clicking on a tile changes the contents of the page to display the official poster for the selected movie along with details such as tagline (if there is one), synopsis, runtime, and average user rating.

The website also has search functionality - the user can enter their search criteria, and the most relevant result will be displayed in the same format as above.
